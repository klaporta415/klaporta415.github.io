<p>Here is a picture of my bike!</p>

	<li>Good Things: Although the website doesn't seem the most aesthetically advanced, it is very functional. It links to multiple other pages from the header. There is a video that starts playing when you navigate to the home page, which is cool. There is a contact option at the bottom of every page which leads to a form allowing you to contact them.</li>
	<li>Bad Things: Something I noticed that was a little confusing was there is a go back button that links back to the previous page you were on. It is only on the "Preparation" page. It doesn't seem that useful since the header with links to all pages is at the top of every page.</li>
